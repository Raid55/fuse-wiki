# Setting up a production server
Here I will go over the steps I took to deploy api.fuse.wiki on a production level on a Digital Ocean server. I will be deploying to this machine:

`OS: Ubuntu 14.04.5 x64`
`RAM: 1GB`
`vCPU's: 1`
`SSD Disk: 25GB`

#### First Step - Making a production user and blocking root from SSH

#### Second Step - Installing packages and setting up environment

#### Third Step - Configuring Nginx and Upstart script to work with Gunicorn

#### Fourth Step - Registering SSL Certificate
