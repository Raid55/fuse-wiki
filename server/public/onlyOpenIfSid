funny meme ayyy ohhhh only the best wuality come and get your popcycles come and get them while they are nice
fresh and hot... we also sell stale potatos in-case funny memes arent good enogh but I mean a potatoes plus a meme
makes anyone say mmmmmm thats a good meal. But anyhow I digress, the real reason why we sell the highest quality memes
is becasue we make them fresh and right fresh from the factory where they are prepaird and made on the spot where they
are tested on multiple test groups to achive meme perfection. Once test groups have approven of the meme we put it inside
of a cartboard box made of wood and we we ship it right to the destination that needs the mem wher th wehre the destination 
at the address of where the meme is been called upon? where the meme has been requested! So from this you can clearly tell
that this is the real high qual and finding a better deal else where is like saying good weed grows on trees, its absoluty
insane. and no im not in the mood for that kind of devils herb its beyond me, i just want to make, produce, invest in and 
promot the best of the best, the cream the la crop of memes thats all i want so imma go back to not doing wastful time stuff
and acually do sometihing. lik make mems or maybe acually do somework other than this bcasue work is important if you are
going to balance it with memes properly. but of course you cant forget carrots with peas and good memes with stale potatoes.
